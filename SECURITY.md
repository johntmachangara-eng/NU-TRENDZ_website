3. Provide as much detail as possible:
   - The URL or file where the issue occurs  
   - Steps to reproduce the problem  
   - Your suggested fix or mitigation (if applicable)

4. You can expect a response **within 5 business days.**

- Acknowledge your responsible disclosure if you’d like.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Since this is a **static website** hosted via GitHub Pages and Firebase, no sensitive server-side data or code is handled here.  
- Firebase rules and client-side code are reviewed regularly for misconfigurations or open access.  
- Always keep your Firebase project rules and API settings secure when deploying forks or modifications of this site.
